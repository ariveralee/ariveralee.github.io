                Without challenging yourself, you never give yourself the opportunity
                to grow. This is why I made sure to go outside of my comfort zone
                and work for different organizations such as
                <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/" target="_blank"> Comcast NBCUniversal</a>,
                <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html" target="_blank"> Lockheed Martin</a>,
                <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"> NASA</a> and
                <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/" target="_blank"> Nasdaq</a>.
                This gave me invaluable insight to the differences between them but also what I
                valued as an individual looking to progress his career. Having interned at
                Comcast NBCU first, I found my calling and joined the organization as a
                CORE Technology Associate in July of 2017.
