                    Hi all! I'm currently a CORE Technology Associate at Comcast NBCUniversal. My first rotation has me in beautiful Orlando, FL working with the GOLF Now team. I have a passion for space (the kind you can't breathe in), artificial intelligence, philosophy and finance. Fall is my favorite time of the year because that's when football season is in full swing. Despite my affinity for deep fried foods and consuming more than I need, I enjoy cycling, running and pretending to be good at basketball.

                    <p>
                        At my current rotation, I'm gaing experience with <strong> Kubernetes, Docker, Node.js, GO, Mongo</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong>

                        Also, have experience in building mobile applications for <strong>Android</strong> For databases, I've worked with <strong>MySQL</strong>. I have experience using <strong> Java, C, Python, HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. I'm currently self teaching<strong> Javascript</strong>. My past internship at NASA has given me the chance to learn <strong>C++</strong> using the <strong> OpenCV </strong> library. I'm interested in hardware as well so I have played with <strong>Arduino, BeagleBone</strong> and <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>

        <div class="dash"></div>

        <p>
          To quote Winston Churchill, "We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give". I firmly believe in helping others to help make a difference. For most of my academic career at Temple, I have volunteered for a non-profit organization called  <strong><a href="http://www.letsgetready.org" target="_blank">Let's Get Ready!</a></strong>. It has been an amazing experience to bond with students and help them reach their dreams of attending college while exposing them to STEM related fields.

                    <p>
                        Since I was younger I have always had a fascination with space that went into warp drive once I began taking physics. My dream is to one day explore the final frontier, hopefully with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson" target="_blank"> Neil deGrasse Tyson</a></strong>. I'm always up for conversations regarding space, physics and science in general.

                    <p>
                        Without open source software, we would not have all of the amazing tools we use today. I have had the opporunity to work on open-source projects with organizations such as <strong><a href="http://philadelphiagamelab.org" target="_blank">Philadelphia Game Lab</a></strong> to help contribute to the community. But also, whenever I come up with an idea myself, I like to share it with the community as well.
